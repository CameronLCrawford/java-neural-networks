This is a rework of a [previous project](https://github.com/CameronLCrawford/cpp-neural-networks) which was previously
implemented in C++ but is now implemented in Java. It allows fully-connected neural networks of arbitrary topology to be
created and subsequently tested on the [Iris flower data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). The focus
of the project is the algorithms involved in this process and a greater emphasis is placed on these over efficiency.

This can be ran by opening the root folder in IntelliJ IDEA.
